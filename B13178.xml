            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas the Kings mo≈øt Excellent Maje≈øtie, for a long time</hi> now together, by all wayes of Mildne≈ø≈øe and Clemencie (beyond that of Soveraign Princes) hath endeavoured to appea≈øe the di≈øorders and Rebellious cour≈øes and proceedings of His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who upon pretences of Religion have ≈øought to ≈øhake off His Regall Power and Government: His Maje≈øtie now findeth that His Princely Lenity towards them hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced no better effects then their encouragements ≈øtill to per≈øi≈øt in their di≈øloyalties and Rebellions again≈øt Him: And in the≈øe their In≈øolencies they have now ≈øo far proceeded as to take up Arms, to gather Forces, and in a Ho≈øtile manner have entred and invaded this Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> And as for their pretences of enjoying their Religion and Liberties, His Maje≈øtie hath already often a≈ø≈øured them of His cleer Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Re≈øolutions therein. Wherefore His Maje≈øtie out of His continued Princely and tender care of that His native Kingdom, hath thought fit (by the advice of His Privie Councell) once more to make this publike Declaration to the world, that He hath left no wayes (be≈øeeming a Prince) unattempted, whereby to reclaim and reduce them to that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and obedience which Loyall Subjects do owe to their lawfull Soveraign.</p>
            <p>And therefore His Maje≈øtie doth hereby further declare, That all tho≈øe of <hi>Scotland</hi> who have already entred, or hereafter ≈øhall pre≈øume to enter, (in an Ho≈øtile or Warlike manner) into any part of this His Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and their Adherents and A≈ø≈øi≈øtants and parts of the Kingdom without any con≈øent, nay without all knowledge of Vs, Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øioner, or Councell, and directly contrary to many ≈øtanding Laws at this day in force in that Kingdom, and yet pretend violation of their Laws, as one of the main cau≈øes of their brain-≈øick di≈øtemners.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:188203:2"/>
            <pb facs="tcp:188203:2"/>
            <p> Here therefore We take God and the world to witne≈ø≈øe, We hold Our ≈øelf forced and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrained to Arm, not onely to reclaim them, and to ≈øet our kingly authority right again in that Our ancient and native Kingdom, but al≈øo for the ≈øafety of this Kingdom, Our loyall Subjects in it, with their wives, children, and goods, as well as Our own, again≈øt the rage and fury of the≈øe men and their Covenant. And this We think fit to let you further know, that We hope in time to make the be≈øt of them ≈øee that We will endure no ≈øuch Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Band in Our Kingdom, to which We ≈øhall not con≈øent: So the que≈øtion is not now, whether a Service Book to be received or not; nor whether Epi≈øcopall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ≈øhall be continued, or Pre≈øbyteriall admitted, but whether We are their King or not: For though in ≈øome of their Libels they give Vs good words, and ≈øpeak Vs fair for their own ends, e≈øpecially in their la≈øt, Printed at <hi>Edenburgh,</hi> February <hi>quarto 1639.</hi> yet ≈øome of them refu≈øe both the Oath of Allegiance and Supremacy, and publikely maintain that they are not obliged to take the ≈øame. Now how can We think the≈øe men are dutifull and loyall in their hearts, that broach ≈øuch dangerous Opinions, or Religiou≈øly minded that teach ≈øuch Rebellious Doctrine, and ≈øo contrary to all which Prote≈øtant Divines teach to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the King and the Civill Magi≈øtrate; Nay, they have infected divers of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-men (which are come into other parts) with the ≈øame Venome; for three <hi>Scots-men</hi> taken in <hi>Wales,</hi> are at this day Impri≈øoned for direct denyall of Our Supremacie and their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance, ≈øaying, They cannot take tho≈øe Oathes, becau≈øe they have ≈øworn to the Covenant. But though We have been thus milde towards them, and continued ≈øo long, yet We would not have any of them, or any of Our other Subjects think, that We can or will permit Epi≈øcopall Government, e≈øtabli≈øhed by many Acts of Parliament in that Our Kingdom, to be aboli≈øhed, ≈øeeing it is known to the whole Chri≈øtian world, that the ≈øame is mo≈øt Chri≈øtian in it ≈øelf, and mo≈øt Peaceable for the Civill State, and mo≈øt con≈øonant to Monarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Government.</p>
            <p>And We would have Our Subjects of that Kingdome con≈øider, what will become of the third E≈øtate there in Parliament, if Epi≈øcopacie ≈øhould be abrogated.</p>
            <p>And further, We think fit to Declare unto you, and to the Chri≈øtian World, That by Our Intention of introducing the Service-Book into that Kingdome, We had not the lea≈øt thought of Innovation of Religion in this or that, but meerly to have a Conformity with that Wor≈øhip of God which is ob≈øerved within both Our other Kingdomes, though ill minded men have wre≈øted ≈øome things in it to a ≈øini≈øter ≈øence.</p>
            <p>We further give you to under≈øtand, that there is a large Declaration coming forth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining all the particular pa≈ø≈øages which have occurred in this bu≈øine≈ø≈øe from the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, atte≈øted with their own foul Acts, to di≈øanull and ≈øhame their fair, but fal≈øe words. But becau≈øe this cannot ≈øo ≈øoon be made ready, We hold it mo≈øt expedient to let this ≈øhort Declaration forerun it, that Our loyall Subjects here and el≈øewhere, may not be infected with their fal≈øe, wicked, ≈øpecious, but mo≈øt Seditious Informations. For example ≈øake in their la≈øt Pamphlet (be≈øides divers other fal≈øe, ba≈øe, and fawning Pa≈ø≈øages) there are the≈øe ≈øcandalous and mo≈øt notorious untruths: As fir≈øt, they ≈øay, That We have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Arms Wee now take, and the Armies Wee now rai≈øe, into the hands of profe≈ø≈øed Papi≈øts, which is not more di≈øhonourable to Our ≈øelf, and the noble Per≈øons intru≈øted by Vs, then odiou≈øly and notoriou≈øly fal≈øe. Again they ≈øay, That ≈øome of power in the Hierarchie of <hi>England,</hi> have been the cau≈øe of Our taking Arms to Invade Our native Kingdom, and of medling with their Religion; whereas it is mo≈øt certain, that no one of them have done any thing therein, but by Our own Princely direction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. And for Arms, it is notoriou≈øly known to all Our Councell then pre≈øent, That their Coun≈øels were for Peace, and have been the per≈øwaders (a≈ømuch as in them lay) of the unde≈øerved Moderation wherewith We have hitherto proceeded towards ≈øo great Offenders.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:188203:3"/>
            <pb facs="tcp:188203:3"/>
            <p> And further they ≈øay, That they intend no Act of Ho≈øtility again≈øt <hi>England,</hi> unle≈ø≈øe they ≈øhall be nece≈ø≈øitated in their own defence. We would fain know, defence of what? Is it of di≈øobedience? Defence again≈øt whom? Is it not again≈øt Vs their True and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Soveraign? If they will defend again≈øt Vs, it ought to be by Law, and not by Arms: That defence We ≈øhall never deny them; This by Arms We ≈øhall never permit them. Now Our Laws which they ≈øeem ≈øo much to value, are in a manner oppre≈øt by them, in ≈øo much that Our Iudges are ≈øo awed, as that they dare hardly proceed according to Law.</p>
            <p>With the≈øe, and the like mutinous Libels, We de≈øire Our good Subjects ≈øhould not be infected, but that all of them might know the pre≈øent nece≈ø≈øity We have to Arm Our Self, which is for no other end, ≈øave onely for the ≈øafety and ≈øecurity of this Our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the ree≈øtabli≈øhment of Our Authorities in that, and the ≈øuppre≈ø≈øing of ≈øuch as have mi≈øled and abu≈øed Our Subjects there, and would (if not prevented) do the like here; but is no way to inforce any Innovation of Religion e≈øtabli≈øhed in that Kingdom, or any wayes to infringe the Laws thereof, or any of their Liberties what≈øoever, which are according to Law.</p>
            <p>The≈øe are therefore to Will and Command all Our loving Subjects of this Our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, That they receive no more of their ≈øeditious Pamphlets ≈øent from <hi>Scotland,</hi> or any other place concerning tho≈øe affairs, which can have no other u≈øe or influence then to draw the hearts of Our loyall People to the like rebellious cour≈øes. And that ≈øuch of Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects here, as have already received any of the≈øe Rebellious Pamphlets, do pre≈øently deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them to the next Iu≈øtice of Peace, that he may ≈øend them to one of Our Secretaries, as both they and the Iu≈øtices of Peace will an≈øwer it at their uttermo≈øt perils.</p>
            <p>And Our further Will and plea≈øure is, That this Our Proclamation and Declaration be read in time of Divine Service in every Church within the Kingdom, That all Our People to the meane≈øt, may ≈øee the notorious carriages of the≈øe men, and likewi≈øe the Iu≈øtice and Mercy of all Our proceedings.</p>
